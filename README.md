EmailMarketer
=============

A small example where Cucumber-JVM is demonstrated.

The implementation aims at creating a system where interested people can subscribe to marketing information.

A blog post describing the development is available at [my blog](http://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/an-email-marketing-system-built-using-test-first-and-cucumber-jvm/).
The implementation is done in baby steps. I hope it is easy to follow and understand. If it isn't, please ask me about the things that are unclear.

The slides I used at the presentation is available at [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/TSundberg/bdd-with-cucumberjvm-as-presented-at-jdd-2014-krakow-poland-2014).

Enjoy!
